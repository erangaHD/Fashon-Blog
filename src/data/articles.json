        "description": "The word perfume is derived from the Latin perfumare, meaning to smoke through. Perfumery, as the art of making perfumes, began in ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Indus Valley civilization and possibly Ancient China. It was further refined by the Romans and the Muslims.[citation needed] One of the world's first-recorded chemists is considered to be a woman named Tapputi, a perfume maker mentioned in a cuneiform tablet from the 2nd millennium BC in Mesopotamia. She distilled flowers, oil, and calamus with other aromatics, then filtered and put them back in the still several times.On the Indian subcontinent, perfume and perfumery existed in the Indus civilization (3300 BC  1300 BC).In 2003,[8] archaeologists uncovered what are believed to be the world's oldest surviving perfumes in Pyrgos, Cyprus. The perfumes dated back more than 4,000 years. They were discovered in an ancient perfumery, a 300-square-meter (3,230 sq ft) factory housing at least 60 stills, mixing bowls, funnels, and perfume bottles. In ancient times people used herbs and spices, such as almond, coriander, myrtle, conifer resin, and bergamot, as well as flowers. In May 2018, an ancient perfume Rodo (Rose) was recreated for the Greek National Archaeological Museum's anniversary show Countless Aspects of Beauty, allowing visitors to approach antiquity through their olfaction receptors. In the 9th century the Arab chemist Al-Kindi (Alkindus) wrote the Book of the Chemistry of Perfume and Distillations, which contained more than a hundred recipes for fragrant oils, salves, aromatic waters, and substitutes or imitations of costly drugs. The book also described 107 methods and recipes for perfume-making and perfume-making equipment, such as the alembic (which still bears its Arabic name.

        "description": "A run of current and upcoming designer-themed dramas—the excellent Cristobal Balenciaga as of last week (if you were lucky enough to to see it in Europe as I was; US release date coming soon), Kaiser Karl and The New Look on the horizon—might finally shake off the idea that onscreen stories about fashion and the people who make it, create it, nay, divine it, never work. Perhaps it’s the historical aspect that helps these productions shine, as recent efforts have been able to cleave to the designs that those couturiers actually created. It makes the fashion part—which is always tricky to get right—all the more believable and, yes, less cringey. (The costuming in Cristobal Balenciaga is utterly fantastic and done with absolute historical verisimilitude—just one of this series’s highlights.) Runway Zero in all this is, very likely, The Phantom Thread from 2017—even if Daniel Day Lewis’s fictional twisted genius borrowed soupcons of a few different real-life designers to make up his Reynolds Woodcock character. (You’re not alone if you thought some of his gowns looked very Charles James.) But while we’re all going to tune in to see the above dramas from Disney+ and Apple TV, who would we love to see given the filmic treatment next? Herewith, just a few candidates—but there could have been so easily more. (We didn’t get to Willi Smith, or Claude Montana, or Stephen Sprouse, or Ann Lowe, or Kenzo Takada—but someone should.)",

        "description": "Twenty years ago, and at the ripe age of 11-years-old, I was obsessed with two things: Britney Spears’s In The Zone album, and the action movie Torque. You’ve likely heard of the former piece of art, but the latter film is seriously underrated. Directed by Joseph Kahn (who also did Britney’s “Toxic” video), the film centers around a biker (Martin Henderson) who’s on the run from various other rough-and-tough bike dudes. Basically, there’s lots of drugs and murder involved—but don’t watch it for the plot. This B-action movie is my secret-favorite because of the costumes. Specifically, the sleek biker wear, worn by cast members such as Monet Mazur, Ice Cube, Jaime Pressly, and Christina Milian. Costume designed by Elisabetta Beraldo, Torque is not the type of movie that generates Oscar nods—but it’s pretty to look at. Two decades later, I can’t help but think back fondly on the endless wardrobe of leather jackets. As the characters race through the streets in their various high-speed bikes, they don edgy moto styles adorned with colorful racing stripes. The fashion is full-throttle, baby! It had such an impact on me that, after watching it, I wore one of my dad’s leather bombers around the house nonstop—thinking that I was a cool biker dude, too. In my very expert opinion, the best scene in the movie is when Mazur and Pressly’s characters face-off in an epic bike race-slash-fight; Mazur dons a skin-tight blue, red, and white leather zip-up jacket, while Pressly, the film’s resident bad girl, is in head-to-toe black leather (with chunky highlights, obviously—it was 2004.) In another scene, Milian rolls up wearing a cropped red Von Dutch halter with skin-tight leather pants. Similarly to the Fast & Furious films, the biker babes are all dressed to kill; There’s a cool nonchalance to the way they clad themselves entirely in leather, as though they’re ready for a rip around town at any given moment.",

        "description": "There is an anecdote early on in Gods and Kings, veteran fashion journalist Dana Thomas’s rigorous dual biography of John Galliano and Lee Alexander McQueen, that makes me laugh. Thomas interviews a fashion writer, Lisa Young, who recalls sitting next to a young Galliano at a London dinner in the eighties. The designer was hailed as brilliant straight out of Central St. Martins, but his first collections had issues with fit. So, “we got to talking about tits, as you do,” says Young. Galliano, who went on to design those famed bias-cut gowns that swirl around curves like wet meringue, clearly got over this particular point of distaste. And then came his instant classic Maison Margiela Artisanal show last week, in which, among other countless moments of glory, tits—and hips, and even pubic hair (they were merkins, but still)—were on full display. The female body, exaggerated to beyond-Jessica Rabbit, beyond-Kardashian proportions with hip padding and corsetry, was presented as dramatic, luxurious, and even a little frightening. And in a first for Galliano, and an extreme rarity for couture, a significant portion of those models were not straight size. Sumptuous flesh for sumptuous clothes. There was so much to look at. But I latched onto the models, toddling and scraping down the runway, the padded hips swaying. There was of course the 6’3” Gwendoline Christie, who closed the show in spectacular fashion in a sheer rubber-accented dress, and the popular Jill Kortleve. But there were also lesser-known faces, like Nyakier Buong, Colette Kanza, Anna Iris Dobson, and Maya Sierón, who had natural curves, beyond what was stuffed. The casting didn’t feature the same few non-straight size models that you see on rotation, the three or so who have managed to really break through. It just felt organic, the models’ bodies serving the clothes and providing a plush drama that suited Galliano’s vision—just like in Brassaï’s photography of bar patrons and streetwalkers, most of whom would not come near fitting a sample size.",

        "description": "From greased mullets to peroxide pixies, Miley Cyrus is no stranger to a subversive hair moment. But at this evening's Grammys 2024 red carpet, the pop star went for a sweeter homage, teasing her hair to heights only achieved by her godmother Dolly Parton. To further elevate (literally and figuratively) her barely-there gilded Margiela look—a kind of chainmail of interlocking safety pins, complete with camel Tabi stilettos—hairstylist Bob Recine brushed Cyrus's locks up and back into a bold Barbarella bouffant. The Flowers singer, who is nominated for six awards, played up her gold goddess look with swipes of bronzer and a single curl that further accentuated her onyx cat eyes and fluffy brows.
